# i2e-shortform-media-piece
This is an intermediary draft for my iCons 2: Renewable Energy Short Form Media Piece. I plan on making an A-Frame application that demonstrates
the merits, drawbacks and potential implementation of using artificial intelligence to design energy-efficient temperatrue control systems.
